The PCF application
My application can:
1. Create products:
In order to do this, a function is defined that accepts input data
on the name of the product and nutritional value.
An array with data is written to a list object.
2. Viewing product data:
The functions for going to the page for selecting the type of information
to be received (name or calories) are defined
There are two functions on the selection page that give names and calorie content of products.}
